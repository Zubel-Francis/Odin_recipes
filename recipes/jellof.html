    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To make Jollof rice, you first create a rich, blended pepper and tomato base, which is then fried with aromatics and spices. Washed long-grain parboiled rice is added to this base with stock, covered tightly, and steamed until fluffy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, divided</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper (or habanero, adjust to taste for heat)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 stock cube (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen mixed vegetables (optional: peas, carrots, green beans) </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch, which helps prevent mushy rice. Drain and set aside in a colander.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the pepper mix: In a blender, combine the red bell pepper, tomato, Scotch bonnet, half of the onion, garlic, and ginger. Blend until completely smooth to create the pepper base.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauté the aromatics: Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Slice the remaining half of the onion and fry for 2-3 minutes until softened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the tomato paste and base: Stir in the tomato paste and fry with the onions for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the color darkens and the oil starts to separate. Carefully pour in the blended pepper mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer the sauce: Add thyme, curry powder, and bay leaves. Cook the sauce, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes until it reduces and thickens. The oil will rise to the top when it is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add stock and rice: Heat the stock in a separate saucepan until hot. Add the hot stock, stock cube (if using), and salt to the reduced sauce and bring to a boil. Gently stir in the drained rice until it is fully coated in the sauce. Add frozen vegetables now, if using.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the Jollof rice: Reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cover the pot tightly with a lid (use aluminum foil under the lid to seal in the steam if needed). Cook for 25-30 minutes without opening the lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest and fluff: Turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.
