    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Fried rice is a flavorful West African dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with vegetables, spices, and proteins like chicken or shrimp. 
        The rice is first parboiled, then cooked in a lightly seasoned broth before being stir-fried with mixed vegetables and aromatics for a colorful, fragrant dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, sweet corn, green beans)</li>
        <li>1 cup diced cooked chicken or shrimp (optional)</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents sticky rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Parboil the rice: Add the rice to a pot with chicken stock, salt, curry, and thyme. Cook until the rice is firm (about 70% done). 
            Do not let it get soft. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Sauté for 2–3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add mixed vegetables, bell peppers, and any protein (chicken or shrimp). Stir-fry for 3–5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the parboiled rice into the pan. Stir continuously to combine everything evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with curry, thyme, salt, and pepper. Continue stir-frying on medium-high heat for 5–10 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat and serve hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
