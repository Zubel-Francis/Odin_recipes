    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Egusi soup is a rich and flavorful West African soup made from blended melon seeds, palm oil, vegetables, and protein such as beef, goat meat, or fish. 
        It is thick, hearty, and usually enjoyed with swallow like pounded yam, eba, fufu, or semolina. The soup gets its unique taste from the roasted 
        or fried egusi and the combination of aromatic spices and leafy vegetables.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups ground egusi (melon seeds)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup palm oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cups beef, goat meat, or assorted meats (pre-cooked)</li>
        <li>1 cup stockfish and/or dried fish (optional)</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground crayfish</li>
        <li>2 cups meat stock</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped spinach, ugu (pumpkin leaves), or kale</li>
        <li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper or habanero (blended)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare your proteins: Season and boil your meat, stockfish, or dried fish until tender. Set aside and keep the meat stock for cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a bowl, mix the ground egusi with a little water to form a thick paste. This helps it clump into soft lumps during cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat palm oil in a pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the egusi paste in small scoops to the oil and fry for 5–8 minutes, stirring gently until slightly dry and crumbly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the meat stock and blended pepper. Add the cooked meat, stockfish, seasoning cubes, crayfish, and salt. Stir and allow it to cook for 10–15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the egusi softens and thickens, add your vegetables (ugu, spinach, or kale). Stir well to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook for another 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning if needed, then remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot with pounded yam, eba, semolina, or fufu.
        </li>
    </ol>
